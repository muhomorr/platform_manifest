Copperhead Limited (Canadian security company formerly sponsoring our project
prior to 2018), Copperhead business partners and James Donaldson (CEO of
Copperhead) have consistently violated the terms of our licenses (including
but not limited to lack of attribution, lack of compliance with copyleft
licensing and more) and fraudulently claimed to have written our code. Our
open source licenses are not extended to them, and they have retroactively
lost all rights to use any GPLv2 licensed code via the GPLv2 termination
clause. This is the result of their continued fraud, baseless lawsuits and
involvement in harassment targeting the GrapheneOS team including spreading
fabricated stories and engaging in doxxing which have directly led to serious
swatting attacks aimed at killing the founder of GrapheneOS.
